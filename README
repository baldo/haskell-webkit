Haskell WebKit
==============
Haskell WebKit provides lowlevel bindings to WebKitGTK+ (http://webkitgtk.org/).

Installation
============
We provide a cabal file for easy installation.

Haskell WebKit depends on:

1. libwebkit >= 1.1.22 (recommended is current version from development branch)
2. libsoup >= 2.28.2
3. gtk2hs >= 0.10.1 
4. ghc >= 6.12 (don't know if it builds any longer with 6.10)
5. c2hs >= 0.16.0 (with patches for GHC 6.12 - e.g.:
   http://old.nabble.com/attachment/27588845/0/04_ghc6-6.12.diff)
6. haddock >= 2.4.2 (required only to build documentation)
7. cabal >= 1.6

Build Haskell WebKit as follows (give --user option to configure, if you want to
install Haskell WebKit as a user package):
    runhaskell Setup.hs configure
    runhaskell Setup.hs build

Install Haskell WebKit by typing:
    runhaskell Setup.hs install

Documentation
=============
Documentation is pretty much copy & paste from the WebKitGTK+ manual with a few
adjustments. Since documenting is still work in progress we recommend to have
a look at http://webkitgtk.org/reference/index.html for the missing parts.
The bindings are pretty much the same way to use as the C libraries. Also refer
to the gtk2hs docs at http://haskell.org/gtk2hs/docs/current/ as Haskell WebKit
won't be very usefull without it.

We have ported a few small parts of libsoup for now. Hopefully the bindings will
grow and become more usefull. For the moment refer to libsoup's documentation at
http://library.gnome.org/devel/libsoup/stable/.

To build the docs available with Haskell WebKit simply type
    runhaskell Setup.hs configure
    runhaskell Setup.hs haddock

The build docs can be found in dist/doc/html/webkit/index.html.
