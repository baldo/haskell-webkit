Haskell WebKit
==============
Haskell WebKit provides lowlevel bindings to WebKitGTK+ (http://webkitgtk.org/).

Installation
============
At the moment there is no way to really install Haskell WebKit.

Haskell WebKit depends on:

1. libwebkit >= 1.1.15.4
2. gtk2hs >= 0.10.1
3. ghc >= 6.10 (don't know if it works with 6.12)
4. c2hs >= 0.16.0

To build Haskell WebKit simply type
    make

Documentation
=============
For now we recommend to have look at http://webkitgtk.org/reference/index.html.
The bindings are pretty much the same way to use as the C libraries. Also refer
to the gtk2hs docs at http://haskell.org/gtk2hs/docs/current/ as Haskell WebKit
won't be very usefull without it.

Licensing
=========
Haskell WebKit is provided under the terms of LGPL. The complete license text is
provided in LICENSE.
