Haskell WebKit
==============
Haskell WebKit provides lowlevel bindings to WebKitGTK+ (http://webkitgtk.org/).

Installation
============
At the moment there is no way to really install Haskell WebKit.

Haskell WebKit depends on:

1. libwebkit >= 1.1.15.4
2. libsoup >= 2.28.2
3. gtk2hs >= 0.10.1 
4. ghc >= 6.12 (don't know if it builds any longer with 6.10)
5. c2hs >= 0.16.0 (with patches for 6.12) 
6. haddock >= 2.4.2 (required only to build documentation)

To build Haskell WebKit simply type
    make

Documentation
=============
For now we recommend to have look at http://webkitgtk.org/reference/index.html.
The bindings are pretty much the same way to use as the C libraries. Also refer
to the gtk2hs docs at http://haskell.org/gtk2hs/docs/current/ as Haskell WebKit
won't be very usefull without it.

To build the docs available with Haskell WebKit simply type
    make docs

The build docs can be found in doc/.

=========
Haskell WebKit is provided under the terms of LGPL. The complete license text is
provided in LICENSE.
